# Throwable Spears
A mod for Don't Starve Together that allows spears to be thrown in addition to their use in melee combat.

Throw spears with right-click. They do the same damage as normal spear attacks. By default, you will miss (and still lose durability) if you try to hit small creatures (bunnies, butterflies, birds, bees). 

This was a mod that I did mainly because I was curious about how it would be done. I've seen people asking for throwable spears to be in the game before, so I figured I'd publish it. I don't think I'll use it myself, though. Any other modders who want to use the code, feel free (for example to make your own two-mode weapons). 

# Installation
I really recommend [subscribing on Steam](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=354415247) instead. It doesn't give me anything or cost you anything, and it will automatically update it and provide it to people joining your server. However, if you really want to install it from here, download a release and put it in your mods folder, and make sure anyone else joining has done so too.

# Configuration Options

Option | Description
------ | -----------
**Miss Small Creatures** | Determines the chance to miss small creatures (defaults to 100%). 
**# Uses on Large** | Sets the amount of durability used by throwing a spear at a large target, in terms of the number of times you can use it before it breaks. Defaults to 75, which uses twice the durability of a normal attack. 
**# Uses on Small** | Same, but for small creatures, if you hit them. Defaults to 5. 
**Check Range** | Enabled by default. You can right-click near enemies you want to throw the spear at instead of having to click directly on them. This helps for small and fast-moving targets, but the range check is a bit expensive, so if it causes lag for you, I'd recommend turning it off.
